    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***Newsgroups Dataset*** is a collection of [newsgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup) posts originally collected around 1995. While the backend code implementation is fairly different, you can think of them as like the Reddit posts of 1995, where a \"category\" in this dataset is like a subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to try to identify the category where a post was published, based on the text content of the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what you are practicing here is using the `sklearn.datasets` submodule, which you have seen before (e.g. the Iris Dataset, the Wine Dataset). You can see a full list of available dataset loaders [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will be using the `fetch_20newsgroups` function ([documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups.html)). An important thing to note is that because this is text data, scikit-learn actually downloads a set of documents to the computer you are using to complete this lab, rather than just loading data into memory in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to preprocessing, every row in the dataset only contains one feature: a string containing the full text of the newsgroup post. We will perform preprocessing to create additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed based on the function name, there are 20 categories in the full dataset. Here is a list of all the possible classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/images/classes.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This full dataset is quite large. To save us from extremely long runtimes, we'll work with only a subset of the classes. For this lab, we'll work with the following five:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'comp.windows.x'`\n",
    "* `'rec.sport.hockey'`\n",
    "* `'misc.forsale'`\n",
    "* `'sci.crypt'`\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas and `sklearn.datasets` to load the train and test data into appropriate data structures. Then get a sense of what is in this dataset by visually inspecting some samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis with `nltk`\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize the case of the data and use a tokenizer to convert the full posts into lists of individual words. Then compare the raw word frequency distributions of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Build and Evaluate a Baseline Model with `TfidfVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB`\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately all data must be in numeric form in order to be able to fit a scikit-learn model. So we'll use a tool from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` to convert all data into a vectorized format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially we'll keep all of the default parameters for both the vectorizer and the model, in order to develop a baseline score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Iteratively Perform and Evaluate Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will investigate three techniques, to determine whether they should be part of our final modeling process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing stopwords\n",
    "2. Using custom tokens\n",
    "3. Domain-specific feature engineering\n",
    "4. Increasing `max_features`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have chosen a final modeling process, fit it on the full training data and evaluate it on the test data. "

Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.\\n\\n       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many\\nof the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      \\nis commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about\\nthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that\\nMr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this\\nascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a \\ndescriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have\\nused it in the past.\\n\\n\\n      The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to\\ndiscuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would\\nnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would\\nnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call\\nto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  \\n\\n      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than\\nme using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have\\nbeen happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are\\nlost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one\\npersons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my \\nmessage to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting., \\nI thought it was 1) wins 2) goals for., I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window\\nmanager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same\\ntime, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have\\nother xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.\\n\\nIn case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude\\npicture:\\n\\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\\n |\\n |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+\\n |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +\\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\\n |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +\\n |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +\\n |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +\\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\\n |\\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\\n\\nSqueezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,\\nwith easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really\\nneed, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.\\n\\nThe only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it\\nis configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit\\nthat file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and\\ntime-consuming.\\n\\nTherefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }\\nfunctions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click\\nof a button, you can change this:\\n\\n    +---------+\\n    + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\nto this:\\n\\n                   +---------+\\n                   + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\n ===============\\n\\nOkay.

So my\\nquestion:\\n\\nIs there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free\\nmemory available to the Xserver?\\n\\nSo one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the\\nCSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory).\\n\\nPlease reply via e-mail, I'll summarize!\\n\\nSincerly,\\n        Matthias\\n, \\n I know that there wasn't other games on the schedule, but ESPN sometimes\\nshows classic games from previous season to fill in the time slot., \\nIt seems to deter those who are executed from future criminal activity.\\n\\n\\nWhy don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes?\\nBlacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal\\nsystem, blacks would be disproportionately represented.\\n\\n(Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\\nsame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally\\ngood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare\\nbetween players on different teams.\\n\\nI agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful\\nare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is\\na missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring\\nthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a\\nbetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice\\ntime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low\\namounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who\\ndoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of\\nquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that\\nthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than\\n+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.\\n\\n+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.\\nYou are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see\\nthat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed\\nis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such., I have a problem with icon pixmap.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we do this on the lawn?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out \\nto the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the stimulus package dead? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You \\nsaid it was a good visit, but no compromise.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \\nwith Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \\nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \\ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \\nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \\nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \\nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \\nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \\nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \\nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \\nabout that yesterday afternoon.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \\nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \\nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \\ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \\ncontinue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \\nboth making concessions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that \\nphase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \\nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \\nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to \\ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to \\nmake those adjustments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the subject of a VAT --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We have a problem with the five minutes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \\nlead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go \\ndown that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \\nthis morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \\nnumber of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \\nat.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \\nmade.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow, have they done that directly through \\nhim?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \\nabout it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \\nthere's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \\nVAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At the meetings that he's had with his own task \\nforce advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \\npossible options would be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been \\npresented for a decision, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \\noption?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \\nbriefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \\nPresident as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're not saying he didn't know it was being \\nconsidered, though, are you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He knew that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \\nThat's what I'm asking.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being \\nconsidered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \\nover the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \\ndon't even know that it's --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at \\nthis stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're \\ngetting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \\nconsidered -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed \\nit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \\nrepeated. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \\nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \\nit were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out \\nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \\ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is \\nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \\nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \\nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \\ncome out not from you people, but --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \\nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said \\nhe would let us know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \\nit's not going to be on the program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On March 25th. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \\nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \\na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \\nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \\nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \\nClinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right \\nhere, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about his remark that if it were being \\nconsidered, he'd tell us about it?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, \\nand he'd let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \\nthis morning?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of \\nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \\nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \\nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \\norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \\nanswered the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying here that it didn't have to be \\ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \\nconsidering it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \\nPainfully clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \\nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \\nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \\nanswered that it was being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, The New York Times --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why do it yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \\nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \\noranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures \\nin a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, \\nbut which turned out to be totally false.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally \\nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \\nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \\nsay that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \\nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he \\ndoing about it, if so?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \\nmistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the \\nmatter.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't that the same information that goes to the \\nPresident?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of \\ninformation.  I think that's where the confusion was.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \\nthat was made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \\nThe New York Times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \\nAnything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on \\nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both \\nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \\nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \\nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \\nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \\nwork, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to \\nget this jobs package going.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \\nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \\namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \\nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \\nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \\nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no \\nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the \\ntiming like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer \\nthis week than you were last week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going \\nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \\nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the \\nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's \\ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \\ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \\nhas changed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on \\nit.  We'll know when the votes are taken.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \\nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go \\nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \\nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \\ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \\naccept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've \\nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted \\nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He initiated the conversation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \\nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \\nsay he's making --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly \\nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that \\nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \\nand the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President \\ndoesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \\nit through, he will.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \\nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \\nthe actual vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will \\nhappen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward \\nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \\nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \\npassed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \\nfirst one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you \\ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \\nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how \\ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \\npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \\nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \\nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \\nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \\ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  \\nAnd I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \\nwe've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \\nPresident and Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \\nto talk to Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \\nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \\nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation \\nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they \\ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \\nabout the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the \\nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \\nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \\nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \\nKohl or Feingold?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is the President considering the more \\npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \\nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \\nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \\nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \\nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \\nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \\nquestion, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \\nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \\nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \\nnot true.  It's actually waste water money.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for \\nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \\nbecause it's waste water money, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \\noverall. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the implication from your statement the other \\nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \\nWould you agree that's not the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I \\nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \\nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \\non a VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just \\ndon't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \\nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So sometime since March 25th?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know \\nthe exact date.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \\nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \\nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \\nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \\nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, \\nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already \\nproposed?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to \\nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is \\nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \\nThe President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't \\nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the \\nincome tax, for instance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \\nSenator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \\nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \\nhave a chance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \\nforward?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \\nif the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \\ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \\nconsideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \\nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \\nthat has to be considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \\nThat's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \\nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \\ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the \\ndeliberations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, George --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \\nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \\nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that the only thing that's changed since his \\nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \\ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \\nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \\nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But this is the President's knowledge that these \\ngroups had come forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \\nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \\npublished positions in the newspapers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's \\npresentations to them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him \\n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \\nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \\ngroups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \\nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \\nthat he had enunciated previously?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had \\nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \\nhealth care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding \\npositions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \\nObviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the \\nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're \\ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \\nchange in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February \\nand now --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't \\nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \\ntable.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's \\nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you're also \\ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  \\nIf these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been \\nmade to the President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the \\npresentations to the health care task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's no relationship at all between the fact \\nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \\nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested \\nthat they would produce all the revenue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \\nappropriate ways to finance health care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that \\nhe said anything to refute that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \\nthere wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \\nof core benefits --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task \\nforce ever suggested that there would.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \\nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \\nprograms?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical \\nsituation.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \\nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \\nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \\non the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the \\nimplications then.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \\nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \\nforce has prompted this consideration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just \\ndon't have that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \\nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \\nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \\noptions are?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \\nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \\nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \\nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not \\ngoing to comment --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the scope --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on \\nthem, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you \\ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task \\nforce is looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the \\nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \\nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \\ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \\nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does no mean yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes and no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the \\nPrime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question \\nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \\nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \\ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \\nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \\nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \\nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \\nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \\nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \\nvery clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your \\ncharacterization of the Prime Minister's comments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \\nnumerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad \\ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into \\nthose specifics until after the meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \\nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \\ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \\nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \\nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \\nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \\npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \\nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \\nMiyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \\nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \\nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \\nmore, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to \\nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to \\npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \\nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \\nwe're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \\npackages.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work \\nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \\nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on \\nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It's a rather emotional response.\"  \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \\nHouse condone that kind of remark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \\nChristopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \\nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find \\nanswers for. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \\nspecific term?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with \\nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \\ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \\nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \\nair strikes, anything that can be done?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \\nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \\nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \\nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \\npressure at this time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \\nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \\nthe presidency?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard \\nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard \\nfor increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the \\narms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \\ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \\nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \\nchange your thinking?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to \\nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \\nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \\nand talking about the arms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \\nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \\ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \\nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That's exactly what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But \\nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \\nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \\nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \\nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \\nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \\nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \\neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \\ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \\nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't \\nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \\nall, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be \\nreleased?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  \\nAnd it will be probably later today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \\norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \\nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal \\nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It's something that the President promised during \\nthe campaign that he would do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't \\nthink it's anything that's on his plate right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  \\nI assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \\ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \\ndifferent groups and communities.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if that's scheduled --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It's a good thing you asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How long --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I \\ndon't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \\nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but \\nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \\ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not \\nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \\nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific \\ntiming of something like that, but it's certainly something under \\ndiscussion and something we've been working on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Campaign finance reform?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think it will be next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working \\non?  I missed the question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  \\nHe asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know \\nanything about that but it's something we've certainly been working \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know what organizations might be represented \\nin this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \\nof town on the day of the march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate \\nmeeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a \\nspeech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \\non Sunday, as he did last year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \\non the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the gays.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \\nPresident's schedule for the day, certainly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is \\nthat Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how \\nlong the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't \\nknow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting \\n-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you \\nabout it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \\nfirst time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in \\nthe Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's \\nnot, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     at the White House in the Bush administration \\ngay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \\nHouse had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \\nsure --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do \\nanything like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Certainly not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What marching orders did the President give to \\nGeneral Vessey?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \\nabout half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \\nhe had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \\nobviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \\nThe President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \\nand said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \\nin our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's \\nresponse to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look \\ninto investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \\nremains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \\nmilitary archives.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \\nactivities of the joint commission and on the document.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis \\nat this stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's \\nalso the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the \\nVietnamese.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A number of Defense officials have been saying that \\nthey think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, \\nnon-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to \\nas Americans from time to time.  Do people -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final \\ndetermination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we \\nhave it, we'll make a judgment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know you don't have any final determination, but \\ngiven all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that \\nthat's a likely possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize \\nit in any way until the review is complete.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech \\nin Boston?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President going to have a press conference \\ntomorrow with Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  \\nYes, I expect, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Toon in with Vessey?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was in on the meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, \\nand the answer is yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal \\nreport this morning the President's distressed about some of his \\npress clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \\nthink the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \\nthat the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \\npoint out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \\nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many questions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \\noccasions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many were while he was jogging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very \\ngood question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \\narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \\ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \\nHe's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \\nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \\nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --\\nEast Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval \\nOffice, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the \\nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \\nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local \\ntelevision anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The \\nPortland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \\nHe's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \\nConnecticut --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The \\narticle implies that he doesn't --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \\nfor it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment \\nabout this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you denying that the President has shown \\ndispleasure publicly?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \\ndiscussions between the President and myself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President write that letter to Chris \\nWebber?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \\nplayer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That is an authentic letter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \\nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \\nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \\nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a \\nproposal he hasn't made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does the President have some agenda for \\nthis meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \\ngeneral meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \\nincluding AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The military issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what specifically is the President doing to \\nprepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had \\ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \\nTrade Representative and others.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     report yet?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report \\nreferred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \\ntoday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the \\nreport's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \\nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \\nthat there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \\nfeels that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \\nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \\nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \\nthrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \\nPresident may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \\nhas the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \\nhistory.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\\n\\n                                 END                    1:34 P.M.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\\nX\\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\\nX\\nX\\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\\nX\\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\\nX\\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\\nX\\nX\\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\\nX\\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\\nX\\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\\nX\\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\\nX\\nX\\t* look at the original source\\nX\\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\\nX\\t* run it through a C beautifier\\nX\\t* examine the algorithm\\nX\\t* lint it\\nX\\t* compile it\\nX\\t* execute it\\nX\\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\\nX\\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\\nX\\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\\nX\\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\\nX    annoy more than amuse.\\nX\\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\\nX\\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\\nX\\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\\nX    working entry is best.\\nX\\nX\\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\\nX\\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\\nX\\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\\nX\\nX\\t#define d define\\nX\\t#d foo\\t\\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tj;\\t\\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\\nX\\tint k;\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tchar *c;\\nX\\ti[c];\\t\\t   <--- use c[i] instead\\nX\\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\\nX\\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\\nX    not portable and must not be used:\\nX\\nX\\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\\nX\\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\\nX\\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\\nX\\t* using va_list as a structure or union\\nX\\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\\nX\\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\\nX\\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\\nX\\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\\nX\\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\\nX\\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\\nX\\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are very hardware specific\\nX\\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\\nX\\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\\nX\\t      code is likely not to be)\\nX\\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\\nX\\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\\nX\\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\\nX\\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\\nX\\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\\nX\\t* are longer than they need to be\\nX\\t* are similar to previous winners\\nX\\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\\nX\\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\\nX\\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\\nX\\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\\nX\\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\\nX    know of a smaller one!\\nX\\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    We like programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\\nX\\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\\nX\\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\\nX\\t* are portable\\nX\\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\\nX\\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\\nX\\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\\nX\\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\\nX    areas really does help.\\nX\\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\\nX\\nX    Be creative!\\nX\\nX\\nXENTRY FORMAT:\\nX\\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\\nX\\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\\nX\\nX\\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\\nX\\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\\nX\\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\\nX\\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\\nX\\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\\nX\\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\\nX\\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\\nX    the entry against the size rules.\\nX\\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\\nX\\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\\nX\\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\\nX    if you did one of the following:\\nX\\nX\\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\\nX\\nX\\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\\nX\\nX\\t\\tcc prog.c -o special_name\\t\\tneed special binary\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\\t\\t\\tneed special source\\nX\\t\\tcp prog.c special_src.c\\nX\\t\\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_build\\t\\t\\tneed special build\\nX\\t\\ttail +4 build > special_build\\nX\\t\\tsh < special_build\\nX\\nX\\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \\nX\\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \\nX\\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\\nX\\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\\nX    'hints' file.\\nX\\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\\nX\\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\\nX    have entry number 0.\\nX\\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\\nX\\nX\\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\\t(not the address for\\nX\\tjudges@toad.com\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t submitting entries)\\nX    \\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\\nX\\nX\\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\\nX\\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \\nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\\nX\\nX\\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\\nX\\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\\nX\\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\\nX\\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\\nX\\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\\nX\\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\\nX    replaced.\\nX\\nX\\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\\nX\\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\\nX\\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.

Information from the\\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\\nX\\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\\nX\\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\\nX    winners at talks)\\nX\\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\\nX\\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\\nX\\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\\nX\\nX\\t* reading the ---entry--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\\nX\\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\\nX\\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\\nX\\nX\\t* linting the source\\nX\\t* compiling/building the source\\nX\\t* running the program\\nX\\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\\nX\\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\\nX\\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\\nX\\nX\\t* best small one line program\\nX\\t* best small program\\nX\\t* strangest/most creative source layout\\nX\\t* most useful obfuscated program\\nX\\t* best game that is obfuscated\\nX\\t* most creatively obfuscated program\\nX\\t* most deceptive C code\\nX\\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\\nX\\t* best abuse of ANSI C\\nX\\t* worst abuse of the rules\\nX\\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\\nX\\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\\nX\\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\\nX    less clear cut.\\nX\\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\\nX\\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\\nX    rules in some way.\\nX\\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\\nX\\nX\\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\\nX\\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.lang.c\\t\\t  comp.unix.wizards\\talt.sources\\nX\\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.sources.d\\t  alt.sources.d\\t\\tmisc.misc\\nX\\t    comp.sources.misc\\t  comp.windows.x\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

For example\\nthe fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not\\npunished equally is an inequality which protects those who have\\na lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define\\nequality to regard the property in terms of it's significance\\nfor the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed\\ntoward poorer people.\\n\\nIn fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal \\nprotection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a \\nmotivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its\\nimpartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.\\nI'm sure that's a great relief to Douglas Meier.\\n\\n\\n, If you'd like to find a home for that beekeeping equipment you'll never use\\nagain, here's a likely victim, uh, customer.\\n\\nTo make a deal, call:\\n\\n\\t\\tLaura Forbes (503)275-4483, Hi,\\n\\nI have the following software forsale:\\n\\nMicrosoft           MS-DOS  5.0         3.5\"DD    $15\\n-- This is a good buy for those who don't need all the utils in DOS 6.0\\n\\nAccolade            Hardball II         5.25\"DD   $10\\n--  Good arcade baseball game, graphics/sound are pretty good, has the\\n    ability to make schedules and edit player stats\\n\\nAccolade           The Third Courier       5.25\"HD     $5\\n--  Adventure/Spy type game\\n\\nEGA                Earl Weaver 2           3.5\"DD      $15\\n--  Good arcade/strategy type baseball game, you have ability to play\\n    for league play,  i have MLB stats for 1990 and 1991\\n\\nEGA                Stormovik SU25: Soviet Attack Fighter  3.5\"DD $10\\n--  Good fighter simulation, various missions and levels of play\\n\\n Sierra                 Thexder FireHawk            3.5\" & 5.25\"  $5\\n--  Arcade shoot 'em up type game, nice music and sound effects\\n\\nVirgen                  Scrabble                    3.5\"          $5\\n--  computer version of the popular board game\\n\\nI'm willing to negotiate on the prices, prices do not include shipping.\\nShipping costs will be split 50/50.

Those letters don't provide \"concrete proof\" of anything at all\\nin the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-\\nally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.\\n\\nSpecifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that\\nincome tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to\\npay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-\\nout declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This\\nissue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect\\nsomething squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of\\nfederal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).\\n\\nUnless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material\\n\"concrete proof\".\\n\\n\\tThere has been no refutation to date.

You've\\nposted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to\\nbelieve that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem\\non the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I\\nfeel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments\\nhave any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such\\nstrange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are\\napplicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal\\nto the Supreme Court.\\n\\nWhy can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular\\nemployee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay\\nhis income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-\\nsion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court\\nwith a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally\\nvoluntary?

I just hope,\\nfor your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of\\nauthority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-\\nical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.\\n\\nFor that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would\\nbe looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you\\ntold us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big\\nbanking interests since the 1938 \"admiralty jurisdiction\" coverup thing.\\nDo you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble\\nto subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into\\ntheir burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right\\ncombination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?\\n\\nNot only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?\\nDidn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US\\nofficials to classify you as a \"14th Amendment federal citizen\"?  When\\nthe FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell\\nthem they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,\\nD.C., where they belong?\\n\\nOr maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you\\nsuggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.\\nIf you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just\\ndeclare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads\\nwith no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet\\ncan just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with\\nplenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).\\n\\nSorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this\\ngarbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-\\ning to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in\\njail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.\\n\\nNeedless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current\\nemployer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to\\ncare too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a \"14th Amend-\\nment federal citizen\", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep\\non filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably\\nnot owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion\\nand/or the foreign tax credit).\\n, In regard to Woody's post, I thought I would remind him of something in\\nthe midst of his tirade against academia:\\nAs a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap Reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant Laffer curve (NOT!)

PDT\\n\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you \\ncould probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \\ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \\nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \\nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \\ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \\nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \\nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \\nare the priorities, because there are several association of \\nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \\nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \\nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \\nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \\nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \\npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \\n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \\nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \\nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \\nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \\nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \\nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \\nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \\nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \\nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \\ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \\nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \\nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \\nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \\nsome influence over the distribution of.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \\nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \\nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \\ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \\nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \\nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \\nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \\nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \\nunpopular.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \\nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \\nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \\nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \\nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \\nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \\ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \\npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \\neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \\ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \\nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \\nour side and on the Russian side.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \\ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \\ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \\nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \\nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \\nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \\npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \\nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \\nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \\nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \\ninvestment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \\nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \\nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \\nof the Cold War.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \\nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \\nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \\nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \\nof a very measured breakthrough.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \\nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \\nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \\ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \\nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \\nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \\nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \\nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \\ninherited from the Cold War?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \\nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \\nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \\nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \\ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \\nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \\nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \\nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \\nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \\nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \\non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \\noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \\nwe agreed to continue to press that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \\nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \\nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \\nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \\nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \\nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \\nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \\nthe NPT regime is critical.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     What was the second question?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \\nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \\nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \\nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \\nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \\nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \\nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \\nleadership of the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \\nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \\nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \\nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \\nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \\nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \\nmuch less.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \\nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \\nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \\nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \\nbegin it in the fairly near future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \\nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \\ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \\npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \\nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \\ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \\ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \\nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \\nlast part of your speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \\ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \\nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \\nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \\nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \\nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \\nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \\nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \\nas much as I could about your history.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \\nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \\npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \\nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \\nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \\nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \\nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \\npersonal feeling about Russia.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \\nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \\nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \\nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \\nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \\nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \\nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \\noccurred.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \\non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \\nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \\ncountries become closer partners.

Every phone comes with a built in\\nchip and the government has the key to every phone call. \\nI go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. \\n\\nWhat's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or \\nbuying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered\\nkeys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes \\nto listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the \\nsecret key registered under my name isn't the right one. \\n\\nThat leads me to conjecture that:\\n\\n1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys\\nthat work for all the phones in the country. The part about\\nregistering your keys is just bogus. \\n\\nor \\n\\n2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks\\nlike this.

That way, the cmap\\nfocus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.\\n\\n(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus\\nexplicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on\\nMB1)., this */\\n     */\\nI tried\\nhow can I\\n\\nDoes the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?

If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\\nit's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're\\nprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware\\ncursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible\\nthat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually\\nchecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just \\nthat.\\n\\nIn reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless\\nof what the server returns., Hi Folks.\\n\\nAs part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple\\nicon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your\\nown applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can\\njust XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately\\nyou can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with\\nicons which your application doesn't specifically own.\\n\\nIn my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in \\nmy icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the\\nicon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes\\nany difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE., \\nDavid,\\n\\n  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)\\nmarket is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong \\nencryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast\\nstandard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,\\nbut it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market\\nwith cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,\\nthe programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.\\nWho could compete?\\n\\n  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures\\nthat it will be voluntary in the future.

Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul\\nStevens, and Byron White are associated with a plurality Supreme Court\\ndecision that prevented the removal of \"anti-American, anti-Christian,\\nanti-Semitic, and just plain filthy\" books from a public high school\\nlibrary [_Board of Education v. Pico_ (1982)]. Does this mean that\\nthey could no longer defend free expression and privacy?\\n\\n- Carl, Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.\\n\\nFirst let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\\nClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\\n\\nThe chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\\ngeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\\nECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\\nconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\\nseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\\nSo if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \\nClipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \\n(Or is it one key per direction ?)\\nThey can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\\nSomehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\\nwhich is now ready to work.\\nThe clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\\nThese 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\\nwith 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)\\nAt beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)\\nbefore sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper\\nchip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,\\nand the session key. This might look like\\nX{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}\\nwhere X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.\\nThis family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)\\nAfter that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet\\nbeing encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.\\n\\nDenning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160\\nBit's.\\n\\nNow, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not\\nbeing an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this\\nscheme, which might be exploited by several parties.\\n\\nAs far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the \\nobvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing\\nthe serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't\\nimagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources\\nfor the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.\\n\\nThen, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security\\ncould (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits\\neach, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply\\nassume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or\\nlaw enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows\\nand l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on\\nand so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding\\nchip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].\\nHow about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that\\nthe police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode\\nthis session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this\\nafter the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,\\nbut I guess politics will not work that way.\\n\\nApparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes\\nof intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-\\ncept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes\\nthe right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who\\nis allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-\\ncations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company\\nto the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far\\nas I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-\\ncompany, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key\\nwill not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable\\nby anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!\\n\\nWhat do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the\\nfirst few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session\\nkey would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so\\ndifficult to do *that* :^)\\n\\nAnd now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about\\nClipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems\\nto have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!\\n\\n\\nNow an afterthought to your rights.

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  ['alt.atheism',\\n   'comp.graphics',\\n   'comp.os.ms-windows.misc',\\n   'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware',\\n   'comp.sys.mac.hardware',\\n   'comp.windows.x',\\n   'misc.forsale',\\n   'rec.autos',\\n   'rec.motorcycles',\\n   'rec.sport.baseball',\\n   'rec.sport.hockey',\\n   'sci.crypt',\\n   'sci.electronics',\\n   'sci.med',\\n   'sci.space',\\n   'soc.religion.christian',\\n   'talk.politics.guns',\\n   'talk.politics.mideast',\\n   'talk.politics.misc',\\n   'talk.religion.misc']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = ['alt.atheism', 'sci.space']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  ['alt.atheism', 'sci.space']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren't from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let's look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average='macro')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what's going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet's take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``('headers', 'footers', 'quotes')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test',\\n  ...                                      remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average='macro')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train',\\n  ...                                       remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average='macro')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task.

In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\n  discussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\n  race and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\n  name.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\n  its informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It’s not going to\\n  be a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\n  American-themed name.\"\\n\\n  https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  - When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n    should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n    by setting ``remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes')``. The F-score will be\\n    lower because it is more realistic.\\n  - This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n    applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n    above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n    as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n    that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n    should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n    output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   *
